# Testing, Testing, One, Two, ...

Introductory tutorial about testing in python.

A presentation is available in the gh-pages of the repository.
The repository contains a new branch for each new step in the tutorial.

## Build slides

It uses emacs's orgmode with [org-reveal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yjwen/org-reveal). In order
to evaluate all the src code blocks you can:
`M-x eval-expression` and execute: `(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)`
otherwise you will be asked once and again.
